# Project Overview - SPED

SPED is a creative blend of:
- Quantum logic gates (forking probability)
- NLP sentiment for emotional analysis
- Blockchain-style permanence
- Recursive literature and surreal AI storytelling

This project was imagined as a way to tell stories where the reader becomes the quantum observer, collapsing narrative waves into new paths—each interaction permanently changing the story's memory.

This is an **experimental, artistic framework** for researchers, writers, and coders who see stories not as lines, but as constellations.

Fork it. Modify it. Dream with it.
