# SPED – Schrödinger's Path: Emergent Design

## 🧠 Project Focus

- Implement recursive narrative adaptation to create dynamic, branching storylines based on user interactions.
- Utilize Python for backend logic, ensuring modular and maintainable code structure.
- Integrate sentiment analysis to adjust narrative flow based on user emotional feedback.
- Incorporate quantum forking mechanisms using Qiskit to introduce probabilistic narrative paths.
- Log user interactions and narrative decisions on the blockchain for transparency and immutability.

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

- Structure code with clear separation of concerns: narrative logic, sentiment analysis, quantum forking, and blockchain logging.
- Use descriptive variable and function names to enhance code readability.
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes.
- Implement error handling to manage unexpected user inputs or system failures gracefully.
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.8 and above.

## 📚 Libraries and Tools

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Prefer using `TextBlob` or `VADER` for analyzing user inputs.
- **Quantum Computing:** Utilize `Qiskit` for implementing quantum forking mechanisms.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Use `web3.py` to interact with Ethereum-based smart contracts.
- **State Management:** Implement state machines or decision trees to manage narrative states.

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

- Write unit tests for all modules to ensure functionality and reliability.
- Use mock inputs to simulate user interactions and test narrative branching logic.
- Validate sentiment analysis accuracy with a diverse set of emotional inputs.
- Test blockchain logging to confirm successful recording of interactions.

## 📝 Documentation

- Maintain an updated `README.md` with clear instructions on setting up and running the project.
- Document the narrative structure and branching logic in a separate `docs/` directory.
- Provide examples of user interactions and resulting narrative paths.
